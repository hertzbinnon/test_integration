Basic knowledge:
	Pixel -
		Image is a matrix containing all the intensity values of the pixel points. 
	How we get and store the pixels values may vary according to our needs, 
	but in the end all images inside a computer world may be reduced to numerical
	matrices and other information describing the matrix itself.
	One pixel represents the intensity which may be only one numerical value or multi numerical
	value stored in memory: 
		If the color system is a gray scale, one pixel is represent by two numerical value (black,white).
		If the color system is an BGR color system, one pixel is represent by three numerical value.
	And each color intensity requires a certain amount of bits, this quantity is known as bit depth. 
	Let's say we spend 8 bits (accepting values from 0 to 255) per color (plane or channel), 
	therefore we have a color depth of 24 (8 * 3) bits and we can also infer that we could use 2 to the power of 24 different colors
	Using a representative numeric range from 0 to 255, 
		the pink pixel is defined by Red=255, Green=192 and Blue=203
	Record struct in memory:
					(255,192,203)
	Resolution - 
		Which is the number of pixels in one dimension.
		1920x1080,30fps,8bits  ~ 1.5Gbps ==> 5M
		3840x2160,60fps,10bits ~ 15 Gbps(7.5Gbps) ==> 50 (40M)
		7680x4320,60fps,10bits ~ 60 Gbps ==> 200M (160M)

	Display Aspect Ratio vs Pixel Aspect Ratio -
		Although the real resolution of a DVD is 704x480 it still keeps a 4:3 DAR because it has a PAR of 10:11 (704x10/480x11)
				704 x 10   	4
				-------- = ---
				480 x 11	3	

	Bit Rate = width * height * bit depth * frames per second

Rate Control Modes -
		Constant QP (CQP): libvpx does not have a fixed QP mode.Setting a fixed QP means that the resulting bitrate will be varying strongly depending on each scene’s complexity, and it will result in rather inefficient encodes for your input video. You may waste space and you have no control of the actual bitrate.
		Average Bitrate (ABR) : never to use
		Constant Bitrate (CBR) : Keeping a constant bitrate (duh); video streaming 
		2-Pass Average Bitrate (2-Pass ABR): Reaching a certain target bitrate; encoding for devices
		Constant Quality (CQ) / Constant Rate Factor (CRF):  Archival; achieving the best possible quality
		Constrained Encoding (VBV): Streaming under bandwith constraints; live streaming (with CRF, 1-pass); VoD streaming (with target bitrate, 2-pass)
		
		Archival — CRF that gives you the quality you want.
		Streaming — Two-pass CRF or ABR with VBV-constained bitrate.
		Live Streaming — One-pass CRF or ABR with VBV-constained bitrate, or CBR if you can waste bits.
		Encoding for Devices — Two-pass ABR, typically.

Color model: RGB <==> YUV
		Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B

Chroma subsampling YUV:
		4:4:4 (no subsampling), 4:2:2, 4:1:1, 4:2:0(U=Y/2,V=y/2), 4:1:0 4:0:0 and 3:1:1.
Frame type:
		I Frame (intra, keyframe),P Frame (predicted),B Frame (bi-predictive)
Temporal redundancy (inter prediction):
		Motion Compensation to eliminate temporal redundancy
Spatial redundancy (intra prediction):
		A 2D transform (usually the DCT) to eliminate spatial redundancy

Encoding steps:
	picture partitioning/macroblock --> inter/intra prediction,motion vector,the residual --> the residual transform (DCT) --> the residual quantizing --> entropy coding -->  bitstream format
		1st step - picture partitioning
		2nd step - predictions
		3rd step - transform
		4th step - quantization
			Quantization to throw out unimportant details (this is the “lossy” part)
		5th step - entropy coding
		6th step - bitstream format

Predictions:
