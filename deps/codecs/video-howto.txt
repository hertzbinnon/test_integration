Basic knowledge:
	Pixel -
		Image is a matrix containing all the intensity values of the pixel points. 
	How we get and store the pixels values may vary according to our needs, 
	but in the end all images inside a computer world may be reduced to numerical
	matrices and other information describing the matrix itself.
	One pixel represents the intensity which may be only one numerical value or multi numerical
	value stored in memory: 
		If the color system is a gray scale, one pixel is represent by two numerical value.
		If the color system is an BGR color system, one pixel is represent by three numerical value.
	And each color intensity requires a certain amount of bits, this quantity is known as bit depth. 
	Let's say we spend 8 bits (accepting values from 0 to 255) per color (plane or channel), 
	therefore we have a color depth of 24 (8 * 3) bits and we can also infer that we could use 2 to the power of 24 different colors
	Using a representative numeric range from 0 to 255, 
		the pink pixel is defined by Red=255, Green=192 and Blue=203
	Record struct in memory:
					(255,192,203)

	Resolution - 
		Which is the number of pixels in one dimension.

	Display Aspect Ratio vs Pixel Aspect Ratio -
		Although the real resolution of a DVD is 704x480 it still keeps a 4:3 DAR because it has a PAR of 10:11 (704x10/480x11)
				704 x 10   	4
				-------- = ---
				480 x 11	3
