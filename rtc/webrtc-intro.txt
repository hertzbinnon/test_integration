Introduce

	An RTCPeerConnection instance allows an application to establish peer-to-peer communications with another RTCPeerConnection instance in another browser, or to another endpoint implementing the required protocols. Communications are coordinated by the exchange of control messages (called a signaling protocol) over a signaling channel which is provided by unspecified means, but generally by a script in the page via the server, e.g. using XMLHttpRequest  or Web Sockets
